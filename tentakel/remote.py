"""Remote command handling module

Provides the two classes which are most important in tentakel:

  - RemoteCommand
    A basic class which needs to be subclassed by plugins. A RemoteCommand
    descendant is a single thread which runs as long as tentakel is running.
    It checks continuously if there is a command to execute by fetching it from
    its commandQueue. The command is then executed by the _rexec method and
    the result is inserted into the resultQueue.
    Subclasses must define the _rexec method in order to be useful.

  - RemoteCollator
    Container used to create and control RemoteCommand instances.
    It is also responsible for outputting the results."""
